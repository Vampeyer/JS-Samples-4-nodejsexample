Hello , this a text from the hello2.txt file ,  
this is a read fnuction being used with  a call back function , 
callback functions ,  are pointer functions , 
the readFile instead of the readFileSync , accepts them. 


with two values in them , like such ,   ( err, txt ) => {  
    the err is the request , and txt is the response. if the response is there , 
    such as the variable txt , 
    then err is only triggered if it isnt true, when ran . 
}
